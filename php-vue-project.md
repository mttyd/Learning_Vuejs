Getting Vue.js in your project

Add a script tag after downloading source or
by using a CDN
``` script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"></script> ```

The Vue instance takes an object that contains the following properties:

el: the id of the DOM element where to attach the Vue instance. In this example, you attached the instance to <div> with the app id.
data: an object where you can declare data variables that are used in your Vue.js application. In the example, you added a message variable that holds the Hello Vue from PHP! string.
